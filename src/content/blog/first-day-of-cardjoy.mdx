On July 4th, 2025, we officially launched CardJoy.

This day is symbolic.
The birthday of America.
A celebration of courage and freedom.
A moment to honor hope and progress.

We built CardJoy with that same spirit — the courage to try, to dream, to begin.
It is our way of chasing a version of the American dream:
Not just success, but the freedom to create something meaningful,
on our own terms, with our own hands.

CardJoy is a product built with love.
It was born just after our daughter, Emma, came into the world.
In many ways, her arrival inspired us to create something meaningful.

It is a product for love.
We built CardJoy to make life’s moments more special — birthdays, goodbyes, baby showers, and everything in between.

It is a product for dreams.
A dream to build something of our own — shaped by our values, our pace, and our hands.

It is a product for patience.
We’re not chasing overnight success.
We’re here to build something great — something lasting — one thoughtful step at a time.

A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Today, we take that step.

This post marks the beginning of an exciting, unknown path.
May our vision be the light, our work the fuel.
One step at a time, we reach for the stars.

To bring this moment full circle, we honor this day with our own card — made with CardJoy:
