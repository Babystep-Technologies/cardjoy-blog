Growing CardJoy is a marathon, not a sprint.
We’ve chosen to start small, grow steadily, and be patient as we learn how to build a meaningful business.
Our vision isn’t short-term—we’re committed to nurturing and developing CardJoy over the years, even decades.

We’ve decided to share our journey on the blog.
To document what we’re learning.
To invite insight and feedback.
And to learn from others walking a similar path.

For Q3 2025, our focus is twofold:

1. Use the product ourselves.
We’ll create cards for our own life events and invite friends and family to do the same—
so we can continuously refine the experience from the inside out.

2. Define our marketing foundation.
We’re reflecting on what makes CardJoy special,
who we’re here to serve,
and how to start genuine conversations with our community.

We’ve identified four key areas of exploration:
	1.	Building an initial social media presence
	2.	Partnering with GoFundMe to help celebrate people going through hard times
	3.	Collaborating with micro-influencers to create authentic POV videos
	4.	Launching our first campaign to encourage people to send a CardJoy card

Each of these deserves its own post—and we’ll be sharing more as we build, test, and grow in the open.
Recently our family hosted a birthday party, and we celebrated using CardJoy!
